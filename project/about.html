        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>In short, I am a curious worldly person who currently teaches mathematics and computer science at school and at Kurta, who loves creativity and questioning. I am always open to learning and trying to work for my dreams. Solving coding, mathematics and logic problems is a journey similar to finding treasure with a treasure map for me, and it is exciting. But my real goal is to be an animation producer and scriptwriter. I hope one day you will be an excited audience waiting for my animation films to be released. Welcome to my colorful and numerical world.</p>
